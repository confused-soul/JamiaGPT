History. A 1970 Indian stamp dedicated to the 50th anniversary of Jamia Millia Islamia. Jamia Millia Islamia was established in Aligarh on 29 October 1920 by Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Hakim Ajmal Khan, Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, Abdul Majeed Khwaja, and Zakir Hussain under the presidency of Mahmud Hasan Deobandi. It was established mainly in response to the demand of some students of the Aligarh Muslim University for a new National Muslim University which would be free from government influence as they felt that the administration of Aligarh Muslim University was of pro-British stance.
It was conceived as a national institution that would offer progressive education and an emphasis on Indian nationalism to students from all communities, particularly Muslims. Zakir Hussain described “the movement of Jamia Millia Islamia as a struggle for education and cultural renaissance that aims to prepare a blueprint for Indian Muslims which may focus on Islam but simultaneously evolve a national culture for common Indian. It will lay the foundation of the thinking that true religious education will promote patriotism and national integration among Indian Muslims, who will be proud to take part in the future progress of India, which will play its part in the comity of nations for peace and development. The objective of establishment of Jamia Millia Islamia will be to lay down the common curriculum for Indian Muslims taking into account the future challenges and will prepare the children to be masters of future.” The emergence of Jamia was supported by Mahatma Gandhi, who felt that Jamia Millia Islamia could shape the lives of hundreds and thousands of students on the basis of a shared culture and worldview, so Gandhi sent his youngest son Devdas Gandhi to teach Hindi in Jamia.
In 1925, Jamia Millia Islamia moved from Aligarh to Karol Bagh, New Delhi. On 1 March 1935, the foundation stone for a school building was laid at Okhla, then a nondescript village in the southern outskirts of Delhi. In 1936, all institutions of Jamia Millia Islamia except Jamia Press, the Maktaba, and the library moved to the new campus. The University Grants Commission gave Jamia Millia Islamia the deemed status in 1962. Subsequently, on 26 December 1988, it attained the status of a central university through an act of the Indian parliament. In 2006, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia paid a visit to the university and donated USD 30 million for the construction of a library and a research center. In 2019, the university emerged as a center of the Citizenship Amendment Act protests after the act was passed by the Parliament. On 13 December 2019, Delhi Police tried to forcefully dismiss the protest of students and threw tear gas inside the campus on students to control their agitation. On 15 December 2019, police entered the campus on the pretext of trying to catch the mob that destroyed public peace outside the university campus. Many students sustained injuries because of the police brutality and it sparked protests in several other universities.

Significance of the logo:
Right on the top is a star with the inscription - Allah-O-Akbar. When, on dark nights, poor travelers have to travel through jungles and there is no one to show them the way, they chart their course with the help of stars. The star of Allah-O-Akbar is the guiding star of Jamia. Jamia focuses on this star, which shows it the path in the darkling world. It reflects the truth that Allah is the greatest, and we bow our heads before Him only, discovering the truth. Having bowed before Him, how can the head bow before anything else?
Beneath this glittering star is a book with the inscription, Allammal Insaana Maalam Yalam (Taught man that which he knew not). This is a verse from the Holy Quran. Through the Holy Quran, Allah has revealed His Will to humanity, abolishing differences of caste, class, color, of master and slave, and becoming true to His tenets. This book led from darkness to light and placed the wayward and lost on the Straight Path. The Prophet made an example of his own life. By the light of his eyes and the warmth of his heart, He prepared a group of good people who cleansed the world of evil and spread the Word of God.
On both sides of the Book are two date trees, typical of the land where God’s last Prophet was born. They are symbolic of the barren valley in which nothing grew, but it was there that the sapling of din took root. These trees are emblems of hope from a land in which not a leaf or flower could sprout, but wherein suddenly the springs of hidaya (guidance) burst forth and drenched the communities of the heart. They are a source of consolation for people who become disheartened with adverse circumstances. Why do external factors make them lose hope?
At the very bottom is a tiny crescent which reads - Jamia Millia Islamia in Arabic. This crescent is small, but just as it expands to become the full moon on the fourteenth night, so also Jamia. Meaning that this is the beginning of our work. It will expand to become the full moon and a source of delight for the eyes of its beholder.
